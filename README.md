## Java Further Classes Assignment

Welcome to the Java Further Classes Assignment! In this assignment we are continuing to practice with classes in Java. You are required to complete the methods in each class. You will find TODO comments in each method, which provide instructions on what needs to be implemented.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `src/main/java/com/example` directory where you will find several Java class files.
3. Open each class file and complete the methods according to the instructions in the TODO comments.
4. After completing the methods, you can run the tests to check your solutions.

### Classes to Implement

1. **Book.java** 
    - Represents a book with attributes like title, author, ISBN, and a status indicating if it's checked out.

    - Represents a geometric shape - circle.
    - Implement methods to calculate its area and perimeter using the given radius.

4. **Square.java**
    - Represents another geometric shape - square.
    - Implement methods to calculate its area and perimeter using the provided side length.

5. **Triangle.java**
    - Represents a triangle with given sides.
    - Implement methods to calculate its area (using Heron's formula) and perimeter.

6. **Employee.java**
    - Represents an employee with attributes like name, ID, salary, and department.
    - Implement methods to get and set the details of the employee.

7. **Department.java**
    - Represents a department within an organization.

    - Represents a student with attributes like name and ID.
    - Implement methods to manage student details.

11. **Course.java**
    - Represents an academic course.
    - Implement methods to manage students enrolled in the course.

### Running Tests

After you have completed the methods, you can test your solutions by running the tests located in the `src/test/java/com/example` directory.

To run the tests, use the command:

```
./gradlew test
```

### Submission

Once you have completed the assignment and all the tests pass, push your solutions to your GitHub repository.

Good luck!
